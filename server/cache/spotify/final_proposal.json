Their target market encompasses a broad demographic of music listeners globally, ranging from casual listeners to dedicated audiophiles. Their business model primarily revolves around a freemium structure: offering a free, ad-supported tier and a premium, subscription-based tier that removes ads and unlocks additional features like offline listening and higher audio quality. Revenue is generated through advertising on the free tier and subscription fees from premium users. Spotify also explores revenue streams through partnerships with artists and labels, and potentially through the sale of merchandise or concert tickets. The core value proposition is providing convenient and on-demand access to a massive music catalog, personalized playlists, and social music sharing features.",
