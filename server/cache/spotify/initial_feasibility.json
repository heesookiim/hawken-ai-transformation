The LLM will analyze user data to understand their musical tastes and generate playlist descriptions and track selections that align with their preferences. The LLM adds unique value by creating playlists with coherent themes and narratives, going beyond simple collaborative filtering to provide a more engaging and personalized listening experience. The LLM can also incorporate external data sources, such as news articles or social media trends, to create playlists that are relevant to current events or cultural moments.",

The LLM will learn patterns of legitimate user behavior and flag anomalies that indicate fraudulent activity. For example, the system could generate a text description of a user's streaming activity, login patterns, and payment information. The LLM then analyzes this text to identify inconsistencies or suspicious patterns. The LLM adds unique value by understanding the context and nuances of user behavior, allowing for more accurate fraud detection and reduced financial losses. This is different from traditional fraud detection because it uses the LLM to reason about the *description* of the behavior, rather than just numerical features.",
