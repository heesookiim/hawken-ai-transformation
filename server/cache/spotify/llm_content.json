    "businessContextSummary": "Spotify is a digital music service providing access to a vast library of songs, podcasts, and other audio content. Their target market encompasses a broad demographic of music listeners globally, ranging from casual listeners to dedicated audiophiles. Their business model primarily revolves around a freemium structure. Users can access a limited version of the service with advertisements (ad-supported model), or subscribe to a premium service for ad-free listening, offline downloads, and higher audio quality (subscription-based model). Spotify generates revenue through advertising sales on the free tier and subscription fees from premium users. They also explore partnerships with artists and record labels for exclusive content and promotional opportunities. A key aspect of their business is content licensing agreements with record labels and artists, which determine the availability and cost of their music catalog. Spotify's success hinges on attracting and retaining users through a compelling user experience, personalized recommendations, and a comprehensive music library, while effectively managing content licensing costs and growing its subscriber base.",

The LLM will learn patterns of legitimate user behavior and flag anomalies that indicate fraudulent activity. For example, the system could generate a text description of a user's streaming activity, login patterns, and payment information. The LLM then analyzes this text to identify inconsistencies or suspicious patterns. The LLM adds unique value by understanding the context and nuances of user behavior, allowing for more accurate fraud detection and reduced financial losses. This is different from traditional fraud detection because it uses the LLM to reason about the *description* of the behavior, rather than just numerical features.",
