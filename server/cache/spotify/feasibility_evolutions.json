      "description": "Utilize an LLM to analyze user account activity, including streaming patterns, playlist creation, social media connections, and payment information, to identify potentially fraudulent behavior such as fake accounts and bot-driven streaming. The LLM will generate a risk score and a detailed narrative explaining why the account is suspected of fraud, citing specific anomalies and patterns observed. This narrative provides valuable context for human reviewers to make informed decisions about account suspension or further investigation. The LLM's ability to understand complex relationships between different data points and generate coherent explanations adds significant value compared to traditional rule-based fraud detection systems.",
