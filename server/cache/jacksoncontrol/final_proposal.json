The LLM will ingest data from various sources, including building management systems, client contracts, and market research reports. It will then generate tailored proposals outlining the benefits of each recommendation, the potential ROI, and the implementation steps. The LLM adds unique value by understanding the specific needs and priorities of each client and generating compelling, persuasive proposals that are more likely to result in a sale. This addresses challenge #3 and aligns with industry insight #5.",
