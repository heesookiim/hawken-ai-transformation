  "Inefficient energy consumption analysis and optimization across diverse medical office buildings due to varying building characteristics and operational patterns, leading to missed energy savings opportunities and hindering the achievement of optimal ESG goals.",
  "Suboptimal predictive maintenance scheduling for building systems (HVAC, lighting, security) resulting in unexpected equipment failures, increased downtime, and higher maintenance costs, negatively impacting tenant satisfaction and operational efficiency.",
  "Lack of real-time insights into building occupancy and space utilization, leading to inefficient resource allocation (e.g., HVAC, lighting) and hindering the ability to optimize space planning and reduce operational expenses.",
  "Difficulty in quickly identifying and responding to security threats and anomalies within medical office buildings due to reliance on manual monitoring and limited integration of security systems, potentially compromising patient safety and data security.",
  "Challenges in personalizing building environments (temperature, lighting, air quality) for individual occupants or specific areas within medical office buildings, leading to reduced tenant comfort and productivity, and potentially impacting lease renewals.",
  "Complex and time-consuming manual processes for generating ESG reports and tracking sustainability metrics across multiple buildings, hindering the ability to demonstrate progress towards ESG goals and attract environmentally conscious tenants and investors.",
  "Difficulty in effectively managing and analyzing the vast amounts of data generated by building systems (e.g., BMS, HVAC, lighting) to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies that could inform operational improvements and cost savings, resulting in underutilization of valuable data assets."
