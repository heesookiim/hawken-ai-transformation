    "description": "Develop an LLM-based system to analyze textual data (e.g., transaction descriptions, customer communications, internal memos) for patterns indicative of fraudulent activity. The LLM will be trained to identify suspicious language, inconsistencies, and anomalies that may indicate fraud. The system will generate alerts for potential fraudulent activities, providing investigators with a summary of the suspicious indicators and relevant context. The LLM adds unique value by understanding the subtle nuances of language and identifying patterns that would be difficult for humans to detect. This will reduce financial losses and reputational damage.",
