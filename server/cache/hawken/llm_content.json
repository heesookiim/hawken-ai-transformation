The LLM will then validate the extracted information against existing data in the ERP system and flag any discrepancies. The LLM will also generate a summary of the invoice for review by accounting staff. The LLM adds unique value by being able to process invoices in various formats and layouts, even if they are handwritten or poorly scanned.
