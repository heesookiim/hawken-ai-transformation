This summary will be presented to sales teams, enabling them to focus on high-potential leads and personalize their outreach. The LLM adds unique value by providing nuanced insights beyond simple rule-based scoring, understanding the context of lead interactions and identifying hidden opportunities.

    "title": "Automated Invoice Processing with Visual Understanding",
    "description": "Implement an LLM-powered system to automate invoice processing. The system will use an LLM with visual understanding capabilities (e.g., GPT-4 Vision) to extract information from scanned invoices, including vendor name, invoice number, date, line items, and total amount. The LLM will then validate the extracted information against existing data in the ERP system and flag any discrepancies. The LLM will also generate a summary of the invoice for review by accounting staff. The LLM adds unique value by being able to process invoices in various formats and layouts, even if they are handwritten or poorly scanned. This will reduce manual data entry and improve the accuracy of invoice processing.",
