      "description": "Develop an LLM-powered onboarding assistant that guides new users through Notion's features and templates based on their role, industry, and stated goals. The assistant will engage in a conversational dialogue to understand the user's needs and then generate personalized recommendations for templates, workflows, and learning resources. It can also answer specific questions about Notion's functionality and provide step-by-step instructions. The LLM will leverage its understanding capabilities to interpret user input and its generation capabilities to create tailored responses and recommendations. This addresses the challenge of low adoption rates and underutilization of Notion's full potential by providing a more intuitive and personalized onboarding experience. A model with strong reasoning and generation capabilities, like GPT-4, would be appropriate.",

      "description": "Implement an LLM-powered system to automatically detect and flag inappropriate content and spam within collaborative Notion workspaces. The LLM will analyze text content, identifying potentially harmful or unwanted material based on predefined rules and patterns. This addresses the challenge of inefficient content moderation by reducing manual effort and improving the user experience. The LLM's text analysis and pattern recognition capabilities are essential. A model like GPT-4, with strong content understanding and classification abilities, would be appropriate.",
