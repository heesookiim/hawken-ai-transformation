    "description": "Develop an LLM-powered onboarding assistant that guides new users through Notion's features and templates based on their role, industry, and stated goals. The assistant will engage in a conversational dialogue to understand the user's needs and then generate personalized recommendations for templates, workflows, and learning resources. It can also answer specific questions about Notion's functionality and provide step-by-step instructions. The LLM will leverage its understanding capabilities to interpret user input and its generation capabilities to create tailored responses and recommendations. This addresses the challenge of low adoption rates and underutilization of Notion's full potential by providing a more intuitive and personalized onboarding experience. A model with strong reasoning and generation capabilities, like GPT-4, would be appropriate.",

    "description": "Implement an LLM-powered system that automatically summarizes and indexes internal Notion pages, creating a searchable knowledge base. The LLM will analyze the content of each page, extract key information, and generate concise summaries. Users can then search the knowledge base using natural language queries, and the LLM will retrieve relevant pages and summaries. This addresses the challenge of inefficient internal knowledge management by providing a more efficient way for employees to find information within the Notion workspace. The LLM's understanding and summarization capabilities are crucial here. A model like Claude, known for its strong summarization abilities, would be well-suited.",

    "description": "Develop an LLM-powered system that automatically categorizes and routes support tickets based on their content. The LLM will analyze the text of each ticket, identify the user's issue, and assign the ticket to the appropriate support team or agent. This addresses the challenge of inefficient support ticket handling by reducing response times and workload for support staff. The LLM's text analysis and understanding capabilities are key. A model like Gemini, with strong text classification abilities, would be appropriate.",

The LLM will analyze text content, identifying potentially harmful or unwanted material based on predefined rules and patterns. This addresses the challenge of inefficient content moderation by reducing manual effort and improving the user experience. The LLM's text analysis and pattern recognition capabilities are essential. A model like GPT-4, with strong content understanding and classification abilities, would be appropriate.",
