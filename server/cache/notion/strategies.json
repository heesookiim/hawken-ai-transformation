    "description": "An LLM-powered feature that allows users to extract information and insights from images of documents, such as handwritten notes, scanned receipts, or screenshots of whiteboards. Users upload an image, and the LLM (using its vision capabilities) analyzes the image, extracts the text, and then uses its natural language understanding capabilities to identify key information, summarize the content, and answer questions about the document. This streamlines document processing and improves information accessibility. The LLM leverages its multimodal capabilities to combine image recognition with text analysis, providing a comprehensive understanding of the document's content. This goes beyond simple OCR by understanding the context and meaning of the extracted text.",
