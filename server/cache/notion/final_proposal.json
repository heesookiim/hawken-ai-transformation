      "description": "Implement an LLM-powered system to automatically detect and flag inappropriate content and spam within collaborative Notion workspaces. The LLM will analyze text content, identifying potentially harmful or unwanted material based on predefined rules and patterns. This addresses the challenge of inefficient content moderation by reducing manual effort and improving the user experience. The LLM's text analysis and pattern recognition capabilities are essential. A model like GPT-4, with strong content understanding and classification abilities, would be appropriate.",
