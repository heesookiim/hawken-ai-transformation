The LLM analyzes the template's content, structure, and formatting to identify potential issues, such as grammatical errors, inconsistent branding, or missing information. It then provides feedback to the template creator, ensuring a high level of quality and consistency across the platform. The LLM leverages its text analysis and content generation capabilities to identify and suggest improvements to the template. This ensures that all templates meet Notion's quality standards and maintain a consistent brand identity.",
